        <p>I've been playing video games since my dad let me play his Super Nintendo when I was 6 years old. These days I mostly play games on my PC but I have countless memories of great times playing with my friends and family. Here are some of the games I love:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skyrim</li>
                <li>Bloodborne</li>
                <li>Monster Hunter</li>
                <li>Super Mario Wonder</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Music has always held a special place in my life and has always meant a lot to me, whether its the perfect playlist or getting the latest speakers/headphones I've always been a huge audiophile. Below are some of my favorite artists (this was a much harder list to condense):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
            <li>The Smiths</li>
            <li>Slipknot</li>
            <li>Tyler the Creator</li>
        </ul>
